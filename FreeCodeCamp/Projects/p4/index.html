            A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a
            pattern against which we can line up our design elements. They help
            us to create layouts in which our elements won't jump around or
            change width as we move from page to page, providing greater
            consistency on our websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            A grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between each
            row and column. The gaps are commonly referred to as gutters.

        <article>
          <p>
            Having decided on the grid that your design needs, you can use CSS
            Grid Layout to create it. We'll look at the basic features of Grid
            Layout first and then explore how to create a simple grid system for
            your project.
          </p>
          <p>
            To define a grid we use the grid value of the display property. As
            with Flexbox, this enables Grid Layout; all of the direct children
            of the container become grid items. Add this to the CSS inside your
            file:
          </p>
          <code> .container { display: grid; }</code>
          <p>Flexible Grids</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Flexible grids with the fr unit</p>
              <code
                >.container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
                }</code
              >
              <p>
                In addition to creating grids using lengths and percentages, we
                can use the fr unit to flexibly size grid rows and columns. This
                unit represents one fraction of the available space in the grid
                container.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Gaps between tracks</p>
              <code
                >.container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
                gap: 20px; }
              </code>
              <p>
                To create gaps between tracks we use the properties column-gap
                for gaps between columns, row-gap for gaps between rows, and gap
                as a shorthand for both.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>As many columns as will fit</p>
              <code
                >.container { display: grid; grid-template-columns:
                repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr)); grid-auto-rows:
                minmax(100px, auto); gap: 20px; }
              </code>
              <p>
                We can combine some of the lessons we've learned about track
                listing, repeat notation, and minmax() to create a useful
                pattern. Sometimes it's helpful to be able to ask grid to create
                as many columns as will fit into the container. We do this by
                setting the value of grid-template-columns using the repeat()
                function, but instead of passing in a number, pass in the
                keyword auto-fill. For the second parameter of the function we
                use minmax() with a minimum value equal to the minimum track
                size that we would like to have and a maximum of 1fr.

        <article>
          <p>
            We now move on from creating a grid to placing things on the grid.
            Our grid always has lines — these are numbered beginning with 1 and
            relate to the writing mode of the document. For example, column line
            1 in English (written left-to-right) would be on the left-hand side
            of the grid and row line 1 at the top, while in Arabic (written
            right-to-left), column line 1 would be on the right-hand side.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can arrange things in accordance with these lines by specifying
            the start and end line. We do this using the following properties:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>grid-column-start</li>
            <li>grid-column-end</li>
            <li>grid-row-start</li>
            <li>grid-row-end</li>
            <p>
              These properties can all have a line number as their value. You
              can also use the shorthand properties:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>grid-column</li>
              <li>grid-row</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>Examples:</p>
          <code
            >header { grid-column: 1 / 3; grid-row: 1; } article { grid-column:
            2; grid-row: 2; } aside { grid-column: 1; grid-row: 2; } footer {
            grid-column: 1 / 3; grid-row: 3; }
          </code>

          <p>
            n alternative way to arrange items on your grid is to use the
            grid-template-areas property and give the various elements of your
            design a name. Remove the line-based positioning from the last
            example (or re-download the file to have a fresh starting point) and
            add the following CSS.
          </p>
          <code>
            .container { display: grid; grid-template-areas: "header header"
            "sidebar content" "footer footer"; grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;
            gap: 20px; } header { grid-area: header; } article { grid-area:
            content; } aside { grid-area: sidebar; } footer { grid-area: footer;
            }
          </code>

        <header>Grid frameworks in CSS Grid</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Grid "frameworks" tend to be based around 12 or 16-column grids.
            With CSS Grid, you don't need any third party tool to give you such
            a framework — it's already there in the spec.
          </p>
          <p>
            This has a container with a 12-column grid defined and the same
            markup we used in the previous two examples. We can now use
            line-based placement to place our content on the 12-column grid.
          </p>
          <code
            >header { grid-column: 1 / 13; grid-row: 1; } article { grid-column:
            4 / 13; grid-row: 2; } aside { grid-column: 1 / 4; grid-row: 2; }
            footer { grid-column: 1 / 13; grid-row: 3; }
